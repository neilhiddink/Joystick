## A UIKit joystick written in Swift

### About

This project began as an experiment with UIView animations in Swift. I have since taken the code that was developed out of that initial exploration and applied it to other open source projects, such as [AutonomouSwift, a self-driving RC car](https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/).
